# Requirements:

1. Yarn package + Node.js
# Quick Start:

1. Run yarn install - install the project dependencies.
2. Run yarn start - runs the app in the development mode. 

# There are other yarn tasks:

1. Run yarn build - if you need just to build the app (without running a dev server);
   Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
   It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
   The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
   Your app is ready to be deployed!
   See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
2. Run yarn test - launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode
   See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
